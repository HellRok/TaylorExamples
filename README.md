# Taylor Examples

## What's this?

These are some examples I ported from
[raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) to show how to use [Taylor][taylor].

## How to run

1. Go to [Taylor][taylor] and download and extract the latest version
2. change directory to the specific examples folder
3. pass the taylor executable one of the examples,
   eg: `$ ~/Dowloads/taylor ./core_2d_platformer.rb`
